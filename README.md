# Dermatitis_model
This is the part used for the deployment of the model (Random Forest) in the thesis.
Cybersecurity certificate: BSD (any use of the source code and data by anyone requires the author's permission)
About the model:
    1. Model used: Random Forest
    2. Platform: Python
    3. Parameters: see the paper
    4. Performance: see paper (doi: )
    5. Number of features: 13
    6. Usage of the model: Simple prediction of the risk of atopic dermatitis in children aged 2-8 years old.
    7. Prediction result: i.e. probability was adjusted to [0.15, 0.9].
    8. Data: there is a need for security, therefore, the uploaded data comes from a random part of the original data sampling, based on the data analysed in this data only partially represents the results of the analysis in the paper.
